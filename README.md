# 🚀 Business Insights 360 – Power BI End-to-End Project

## 🧠 Project Summary

**AtliQ Hardware** has been expanding rapidly, but recent decisions based on gut instinct and Excel analysis led to financial losses—especially in their U.S. operations. To stay competitive and data-driven, they’ve decided to adopt **Power BI** as their business intelligence platform.

This project aims to provide a 360° view of business performance across departments—**Sales, Finance, Marketing, and Supply Chain**—through interactive dashboards.

## ❓ Pre-Project Questions – Aligning with Stakeholders

Before building the dashboard, it's crucial to ask:

- What’s the objective of this dashboard?  
- How will we define project success?  
- Who are the end users and what are their goals?  
- Are preview demos needed before final delivery?  
- What fears or expectations do stakeholders have?  
- What resources, datasets, or design inputs are required?
